## Features

- **Roadmap**: show users what you're working on
- **Simple Sign In**: let users log in with email or any OAuth2 provider
- **Webhooks**: integrate with your existing tools (e.g. Jira, Trello, Slack)
- **API**: programmatically manage your feedback space with our REST API
- **Moderation Queue**: decide whether to show new feedback immediately or request approval
- **Anonymous Feedback**: enable unregistered users to publish feedback
- **... and more**: invitation system, brand customization, recap emails for administrators, private site settings, and more!

## Get started

### Hosted

We offer a hosted solution, so you don't have to provision your own server. This is the easiest and fastest way to get started: you can sign up and start collecting feedback in a few minutes.

[Start your 7-day free trial](https://login.astuto.io/signup) without entering any payment method, then it's 15Â â‚¬/month with annual subscription or 20 â‚¬/month with monthly subscription. [Learn more on astuto.io](https://astuto.io/?utm_campaign=github_getstarted&utm_source=github.com).

With the paid plan:

- You avoid deployment hassles like renting a server, issuing SSL certificates, configuring a mail server and managing updates
- You get some OAuth providers out of the box: Google, Facebook and GitHub are ready to log your users in, no configuration needed
- You get priority support
- You support open source and get our eternal gratitude :)


### Self-hosted

Read the [Deploy with Docker instructions](https://docs.astuto.io/deploy-docker) for the most comprehensive and up to date guide on installing and configuring Astuto.

What you find below are minimal instructions to get you started as quickly as possible:

0. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed
1. Create an empty folder
2. Inside that folder, create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:
```
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:14.5
    environment: &db-env
      POSTGRES_USER: yourpostgresusername
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: yourpostgrespassword
    volumes:
      - dbdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  web:
    image: riggraz/astuto:latest
    environment:
      <<: *db-env
      BASE_URL: http://yourwebsite.com
      SECRET_KEY_BASE: yoursecretkeybase
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - db
    
volumes:
  dbdata:
```
3. Edit the environment variables to fit your needs. You can find more information about env variables in the [documentation](https://docs.astuto.io/deploy-docker/#2-edit-environment-variables).
4. Run `docker compose pull && docker compose up`
5. You should now have a running instance of Astuto on port 3000. A default user account has been created with credentials email: `admin@example.com`, password: `password`.
