## What is Astuto?

Astuto is a free, open source, self-hosted customer feedback tool. It helps you collect, manage and prioritize feedback from your users. It has been heavely inspired by [Canny.io](https://canny.io/) ("astuto", indeed, is the italian translation of the word "canny").

If you want to try Astuto out there is a work-in-progress demo <a href="http://65.21.148.99:3000/">available here</a>.

## Features

* Collect and manage feedback
* Boards, to divide different types of feedback
* Roadmap, to let your users know what you're working on
* Comments, to discuss with your customers
* Notifications, to inform users of updates or comments
* Markdown support, to style feedback proposals or board description
* Feedback status, to inform about the state of a certain feedback
* Completely customizable (i.e. you can add/edit/remove as many boards, feedback statuses as you want; you can configure the roadmap the way you want; etc.)
* Unlimited administrators/moderators allowed

## Requirements

* Docker ([installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/))
* Docker Compose ([installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/))

## Installation

**Note**: it is strongly suggested to run Astuto on Linux or macOS. As of today, Windows is likely to [cause problems](https://github.com/riggraz/astuto/wiki/Common-problems#standard_init_linuxgo211-exec-user-process-caused-no-such-file-or-directory). If you want to try anyway, follow along with the [Windows users installation guide](https://github.com/riggraz/astuto/wiki/Installation-for-Windows-users).

### Using DockerHub image (fastest)

Coming soon!

### Manual (for development)

1. Clone this repository.
2. In Astuto's root directory, create a file named `.env` and fill it with the required environment variables (see `.env-example` for an example and check [this wiki page](https://github.com/riggraz/astuto/wiki/Required-environment-variables) for an explanation of the variables).
3. Run `script/docker-update-and-run.sh`.
4. You should now have a running instance of Astuto at `localhost:3000`. A default user account has been created with credentials email: `admin@example.com`, password: `password`.

## Post-installation notes

* **If you run into any problems take a look at the [common problems page](https://github.com/riggraz/astuto/wiki/Common-problems)**.
* When you want to launch Astuto you have to run `script/docker-run.sh`. If you installed new gems, packages or updated the database schema, you first need to run `script/docker-update.sh` and then `script/docker-run.sh`. You can run them together with `script/docker-update-and-run.sh`.
* If you changed some environment variables in `.env` you have to restart the instance for these changes to take effect.
